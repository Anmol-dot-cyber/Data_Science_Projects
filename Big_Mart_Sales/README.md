# Problem_Statement

The Data Enginners have collected data of a supermarket- Bigmart for various products across 10 stores in various cities.
They have also defined attributes for each product and store.

# Objective
The Objective of the project is to build a predictive Machine Learning (ML) model and to predict product wise sales for particular store.

By Using the ML model, BigMart will try to understand the Characteristics of products and behaviour of stores which play a diverse role in increment of sales.

## Data_Explaination
We have train (8523) and test (5681) data set, train data set has both input and output variable(s). You need to predict the sales for test data set.

Item_Weight | Weight of product
Item_Fat_Content | Whether the product is low fat or not
Item_Visibility | The % of total display area of all products in a    store allocated to the particular product
